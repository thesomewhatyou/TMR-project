# Welcome!

Hi, welcome to thesomewhatyou's Old School Computer Revival Project. (TOSCR-project)

This is a modpack for iMacs with the Intel chipset and Intel Integrated Graphics. This optimizes Minecraft without adding unnecessary items. 

## ⚠️ Warning! ⚠️

This is a highly experimental modpack. FYI, I am **NOT** a professional. Issues can be reported on GitHub/Discord. (in development)

TOSCR-project is a very iffy modpack, as monthly updates will be provided, but they may not be optimal. EOL will be announced once things change, as it is now very predictable whether or not this modpack will be discontinued. What I can guarantee is:
* No bugs that affect gameplay
* A slow, yet steady release
* And most importantly, around 100+ FPS for iMacs using this.
  

### Note:

This can work on virtually any iMac. I'm just making this modpack for Intel series iMacs because from my experience I've seen wonders.
Graphic design is my passion by the way, how'd you notice?

## thesomewhatyou, why'd ya do this?

I use a crusty old iMac. I know some people that still use it to this day. _(cough Christopher cough)_ Minecraft runs horribly on these kinda iMacs, with major stuttering and a deadly amount of lag (a lot worse than this modpack could be). That's why I made TOSCR-project. It can solve some lag and almost eliminate stutter.

## Minecraft Modpack Details

### Installation
Just plop the file in MultiMC (or a fork of it!) and an instance will be instantly made. Using Modrinth? Just look up the modpack itself on Modrinth, as the modpack has been approved on the platform.

### Mod List
The mod list is very complicated. If you are using either launcher, you can easily view the mods and disable them at will!

### Configuration
Configuring is super easy! Mod List is included with the modpack, allowing for easy customization, and not having to modify .jsons like a person who says "btw i use arch" on a daily basis.

### Compatibility
Some basic mods might not work with this modpack. Before using this, make sure that the mods you can add are ready-to-use with this modpack. There are no known issues yet. Issues can be reported on THIS GitHub directory.

## Restrictions:

This modpack is protected under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal.

# Statement

This project will be **entirely free, forever.** You heard me right! No donations shall be taken. My only revenue will be Modrinth giving me the bag.
Or, eight cents.

## Anyways...

If you ever do download this, thanks. I'm working pretty hard on this, and I'm investigating things I do not know about. I want the Minecraft community to be happy. Downloading this, or even just reading this brings me joy. Bye! ❤️

### Also, here's a demo.
