# Welcome!

Hi, welcome to thesomewhatyou's Mac Revival Project. (TMRP)

This is a modpack for iMacs with the Intel chipset and Intel Integrated Graphics. This optimizes Minecraft without adding unnecessary items. 

## ⚠️ Warning! ⚠️

This is a highly experimental modpack. FYI, I am **NOT** a professional. Issues can be reported on GitHub/Discord. (in development)

TMRP is a very iffy modpack, as monthly updates will be provided, but they may not be optimal. EOL will be announced once things change, as it is now very predictable whether or not this modpack will be discontinued. What I can guarantee is:
* No bugs that affect gameplay
* A slow, yet steady release
* And most importantly, around 100+ FPS for iMacs using this.
  

### Note:

This can work on virtually any iMac. I'm just making this modpack for Intel series iMacs because from my experience I've seen wonders.
Graphic design is my passion by the way, how'd you notice?

## thesomewhatyou, why'd ya do this?

I use a crusty old iMac. I know some people that still use it to this day. _(cough Christopher cough)_ Minecraft runs horribly on these kinda iMacs, with major stuttering and a deadly amount of lag (a lot worse than this modpack could be). That's why I made TMRP. It can solve some lag and almost eliminate stutter.

## Restrictions:

There aren't any! This modpack can be designed to your liking, with optimization mods as a base. Adding mods manually is a pain, especially if you download the .jar files directly (I don't). As long as you credit me, remixing this and posting this is **legal.** Plus, also credit the mod creators (which on Modrinth, is a bit excessive as it already shows all the mods) so you don't get sued.

# Statement

This project will be **entirely free, forever.** You heard me right! No donations shall be taken. My only revenue will be Modrinth giving me the bag.
Or, eight cents.

## Anyways...

If you ever do download this, thanks. I'm working pretty hard on this, and I'm investigating things I do not know about. I want the Minecraft community to be happy. Downloading this, or even just reading this brings me joy. Bye! ❤️

### Also, here's a demo.
